Welcome! I am a master’s student in Biomedical Data Science at Universitat Rovira i Virgili and other participating universities in Catalonia. I previously studied Computer Engineering at the Facultat d’Informàtica de Barcelona (UPC).

I have a broad interest in machine learning, with a particular focus on building interpretable models. I’m interested in applying data science across a range of domains, including sports, social sciences, finance, and biology.

During my bachelor’s thesis, I worked on deploying and training neural networks on-device for the Arduino H7, enhanced with federated learning.
